While scientists are increasingly appreciating and incorporating natural variability into experiments, this is an active area of research with so much still to be discovered! I'm interested in the mechanisms animals use to cope with different types of variation and have studied this a bit in my own thesis, looking at how diet may influence acclimation rates, acute thermal performance curves, and acclimation capacity. I've also had the opportunity to help out with some awesome projects lead by other researchers -- check out Sam csik's work looking at month long acclimation impacts of temperature on California spiny lobster predator-prey interactions and metabolism or Dr. Gail Schwieterman's work on how daily temperature swings affect cardiac acclimation in opaleye.\n\n<center>\n\n\n::: {.cell .fig-cap-location-margin layout-ncol=\"1\" layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Opaleye and purple urchins at Catalina Island, CA, USA - photo credit: Jacey Van Wert](opaleye_wild_1.jpeg){fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n![opaleye](opaleye_wild_1.jpeg){height=4in}\n\n</center>\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n#### **Relevant publications:**\n\n-   **Emily A.
