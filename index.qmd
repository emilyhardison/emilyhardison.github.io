<h class = "large-gray-text-1">Hi, I'm Emily </h>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm an ecophysiologist broadly interested in how animals respond to environmental change. I completed my PhD in the Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology department at UC Santa Barbara in [**Dr. Erika Eliason's lab**](https://erikaeliason.com/). For my thesis, I studied how changes in fish nutrition impacts their thermal plasticity and thermal tolerance. Next up, I will be joining [**Dr. Kevin Kohl's lab**](https://www.kohl-lab.com/) at the University of Pittsburgh as a NSF post-doctoral research fellow.
