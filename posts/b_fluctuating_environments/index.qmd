How do animals cope with environmental changes occurring across timescales (from minutes to days to weeks to years)? While scientists are increasingly appreciating and incorporating natural variability into experiments, this is an active area of research with so much still to be discovered! I'm interested in the mechanisms animals use to cope with different types of environmental variation and have studied this a bit in my own thesis, looking at how diet may influence acclimation rates, acute thermal performance curves, and acclimation capacity. I've also had the opportunity to help out with some awesome projects lead by other researchers -- check out Sam csik's work looking at month long acclimation impacts of temperature on California spiny lobster predator-prey interactions and metabolism or Dr. Gail Schwieterman's work on how daily temperature swings affect cardiac thermal acclimation in opaleye.
