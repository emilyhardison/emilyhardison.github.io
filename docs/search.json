    "text": "How do animals cope with environmental changes occurring across timescales (from minutes to days to weeks to years)? Animals living in temperate environments need to be able to cope with rapid and more prolonged changes in temperature. While scientists are increasingly appreciating and incorporating natural variability into experiments, this is an active area of research with so much still to be discovered! I’m interested in the mechanisms animals use to cope with different types of variation and have studied this a bit in my own thesis, looking at how diet may influence acclimation rates, acute thermal performance curves, and acclimation capacity. I’ve also had the opportunity to help out with some awesome projects lead by other researchers – check out Sam csik’s work looking at month long acclimation impacts of temperature on California spiny lobster predator-prey interactions and metabolism or Dr. Gail Schwieterman’s work on how daily temperature swings affect cardiac acclimation in opaleye.\n\n\n\nRelevant publications:\n\nEmily A.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Female salmon suffer higher rates of en route mortality than males during their upriver migration. The Eliason lab has been exploring the drivers of this phenomenom. In 2017, I had the opportunity to travel to Cultus Lake in British Columbia, Canada, and participate in an ongoing project in the Eliason Lab on female-biased mortality in coho salmon. This work was led by Dr. Erika Eliason and was a large collaborative effort involving researcher’s from UBC, UCSB, Carlton University, and DFO. While we didn’t figure out exactly why the females were dying, we did learn a lot about coho salmon energetics, thermal sensitivity, swimming performance, and more! Here are some of the photos from the trip.
